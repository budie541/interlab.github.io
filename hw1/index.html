	<p> I took a coding class in high school that was mandatory and covered the basics of html and css, though I don't remember much of it. I relearned most of it last semester in Interaction 1 (used GitHub and Sublime). Honestly the most difficult part was trying to understand how everything worked, so I relied more heavily on searching things up and basing everything on what I found instead of actually understanding the content. I never really wanted to learn to code, but I figured it would be a helpful skill to have, and I never would have taught it to myself.
		<br> <br>
	I think HTML is the content itself and its basic formatting and CSS and JavaScript are the styling/how the content is presented (?)</p>

	<h1> Indonesian anything </h1>
	<h2> Hotpot </h2>
	<h3> Bread with a dip or something </h3>
	<h4> Fish (general) </h4>
	<h5> Root vegetables (general also) </h5>

		<li> <a href="https://hato.store/collections/all-books"> HATO STORE</a> <br> I think I lean more towards print media than I do web design, and this website is just something I was looking at recently because some designers I like have their work distributed by them. I don't really have design related websites I keep as references because I never have to do this kind of work, but I'll find some in time </li>
		<li> <a href="https://coverjunkie.com/"> COVERJUNKIE</a> <br> This site also has to do more with print media, showing cover designs and organizing them in a way which is easy to browse.</li>
